Welcome to \\\\Backlogged___ ! 

Backlogged makes remembering, organizing and prioritizing your want-to-do lists easy!
Simply click the ADD button to start keeping track of something you want to remember, note what you're thinking of, maybe assign a priority or even a due date and now you can see it listed and sorted with your other 'backlog' items!

FAVICONS - After creating the base project and deleting some of the vite default files, an error was appearing in the browser console window about missing favicons. After a quick search I went to redketchup.io/favicon-generator and created some to include in the project.
This also added a webmanifest that helps android with the icons and also passes app name and description (etc) to a browser.

DOTENV
add to gitignore:
.env file for
    port number,
    db connection string,
    tokens,
    account information
Create a separate .env file for use in production .env.production
Vars should look like this: REACT_APP_API_KEY=abc123
Except it seems that in a Vite setup they should be VITE_API_KEY
Access these in code like this: const apiKey = process.env.REACT_APP_API_KEY;
https://vitejs.dev/guide/env-and-mode 
UPDATE:
install dotenv
Looks like all I needed was: 
import dotenv from "dotenv";
dotenv.config();
const port = process.env.REACT_APP_PORT ?? 3000;

In some cases it will be preferable to use a secrets management system.


Project Tracking
I found that I can use Jira for free, created an account and began setting up for tracking this app. As I was looking into integration with github, I found that github also has a free project tracking tool, github Projects. I've decided to go with github Projects for now, since I already have experience with Jira and because I want to see how the integration works out.
So far it seems like a decent, simple tool - though some things seem to not be as straightforward as they should be. For example, every time I open Projects and want to create an 'issue', I have to select the Backlogger project again. I created a separate project for pixelFlip. It appears that you may want to reference multiple repositories with a single project? It would be nice if they made it simpler for my OWN use cases... :D

Folders, Folders and Folders, separation of concerns, general template, best practices
So many folders compared to previous projects, I've been trying to embrace some ideas for working with larger projects, even though I may not really need it here, so it's leaning toward better separation of concerns and best practices - at least as far as my beginner's understanding goes.
